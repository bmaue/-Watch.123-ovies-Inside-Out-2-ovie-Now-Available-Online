Inside Out 2 has entered the MCU after an agonizing wait, with opportunities to watch and stream the anticipated movie finally becoming available. The MCU's only cinematic release of 2024 has received an immense level of hype as Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman finally come together for their iconic team-up as the titular heroes. They are joined by a whose-who of Marvel movie characters whose careers span decades, including several returning X-Men characters such as Tyler Mane's Sabretooth, Aaron Stanford's Pyro, and Jason Flemyng's Azazel.

Inside Out 2 is Shawn Levy's first shot at directing a Inside Out 2 movie, although he has worked with Ryan Reynolds in the past in Free Guy and The Adam Project. His comedy credentials make him a good fit for the famously irreverent Inside Out 2 franchise, which continues the iconic brand of R-rated humor established in Inside Out 2 and Inside Out 2 2, though this time takes things into the MCU timeline. Marvel has been keeping its cards close to its chest when it comes to Inside Out 2 details, which is a sentiment that extends to its expected release schedule.

Available In Several Premium Formats, The exclusive theatrical release of Inside Out 2 begins on July 26, 2024. It is the MCU's first R-rated movie, which means that anyone under the age of 17 is required to be accompanied by an adult if watching Inside Out 2 in theaters. This rating is largely due to the no-holds-barred violence that typifies Inside Out 2's cinematic career, but strong language and sexual references are also to be expected.

Inside Out 2 Streaming Release Date?

Inside Out 2 will eventually be released on Disney+, rather than Netflix or Max, as the movie is produced and distributed by Disney. Disney has yet to announce a streaming release date for Inside Out 2. The three latest MCU movies to hit streaming — The Marvels, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — all came to Disney+ 89 days after their theatrical debuts. Should the distributor follow suit here, Inside Out 2 would come to Disney+ on October 23.

Is 'Inside Out 2' in Theaters?

Yes, Inside Out 2 will be a big-screen adventure well-suited for two of Marvel's most beloved characters. The hugely anticipated team-up won't have to tangle with too much competition that weekend, though the disaster film sequel Inside Out 2 did storm into theaters a week earlier. The week after Inside Out 2, the film will then be sharing theater space with M. Night Shyamalan's new thriller Inside Out 2, Colman Domingo's Oscar hopeful Inside Out 2, and Zachary Levi's children's book adaptation Harold and the Purple Crayon.

Watch the Trailer for 'Inside Out 2'?

The release of Inside Out 2 may be just around the corner, but Marvel dropped one more special look at the upcoming film just a week before the big premiere day. Apart from a quick reference to Spider-Man at the end, the final trailer is a big departure from the previous trailers by focusing much more on the emotional core of both Inside Out 2 and Wolverine. However, that's not why this trailer has gotten people talking. Not only does it give us a proper look at Lady Inside Out 2 (who is rumored to be played by Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife Blake Lively), but the trailer confirms that Dafne Keen will indeed be reprising her role as Logan's surrogate daughter, X-23, last seen in the film Logan.

When Will Inside Out 2 Release On Streaming?

Inside Out 2 Will Stream On Disney Plus. There is no official word on when Inside Out 2 will be available to stream.

When Will Inside Out 2 Release On Digital , DVD & BLU-Ray?

Before Inside Out 2 is available to stream with a subscription to Disney Plus, it will be available to buy/rent and download digitally via VOD services likely at a price between $15 - $20. Again, Marvel Studios has yet to confirm a date when Inside Out 2 will release digitally on home media, though it will probably be around Fall 2024, and September at the earliest. This format should come with behind-the-scenes featurettes and other extra features like gag reels, though the full details of what it will contain has to be confirmed.
